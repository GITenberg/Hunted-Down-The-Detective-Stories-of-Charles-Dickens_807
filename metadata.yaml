description: Charles Dickens was one of the great pioneers of detective fiction. While
  the larger-than-life characters in his novels have settled themselves in the public
  imagination, his detectives have had a profound effect on the development of crime
  fiction, and Dickens is now seen as the first major publicist for the police detective.
  In Hunted Down, Peter Haining has assembled a fascinating selection of Dicken's
  detective stories. Added to these are extracts from the novels in which the men
  of the law make their mark, including Mr Nadgett from Martin Chuzzlewit , the first
  serious detective in an English novel, and Inspector Bucket from Bleak House.
